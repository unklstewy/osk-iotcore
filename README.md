# OSK IoT Core

A comprehensive IoT core platform for managing and orchestrating Internet of Things devices and services.

## Overview

OSK IoT Core is designed to provide a robust, scalable foundation for IoT device management, data collection, and service orchestration. This platform enables seamless integration of diverse IoT devices while providing secure, reliable communication and data processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Device Management**: Comprehensive device lifecycle management including provisioning, monitoring, and maintenance
- **Data Processing**: Real-time data ingestion, processing, and analytics
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption and secure device authentication
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable architecture supporting thousands of connected devices
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs for third-party integrations and custom applications
- **Dashboard**: Web-based management interface for monitoring and control

## Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with the following key components:

- **Device Gateway**: Handles device connections and protocol translation
- **Data Pipeline**: Processes and routes IoT data streams
- **Device Registry**: Manages device metadata and configurations
- **Analytics Engine**: Provides real-time analytics and insights
- **API Gateway**: Manages external API access and authentication
